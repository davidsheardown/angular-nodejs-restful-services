REST

    Stands for REpresetational State Transfer
        We want to transfer state between one type of client up to our server or back
        Architectural style for distributed systems
        Resources are identified with a URI
            So anything that understands HTMLcan interacti with REST services
        
Promises vs Observables

    Promises   

        The component makes a call to the service which returns a promis. This is hooked up to a callback and then data is passed down when it becomes available
    
    Observables

        The component subscribes to a service which will return data overtime. Rather than having a callback per data returned, we can have data "piped" over
